-- I would normally include a numeric PK, but this caused
-- issues with the mysqlimport tool.  Rather than find another
-- workaround for this, I omitted the PK for the purposes of this exercise
-- The symbol size should also be 5, but some of the symbols have carats.
-- A more robust solution that mysqlimport would be required to keep these
-- out of the database, so they are removed in the query layer instead.
